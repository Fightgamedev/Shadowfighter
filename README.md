# Shadow Fighters

A lightweight 2D arcade fighting game built with **LÖVE 11.5**.

We're building this as a **2-person team**, so this guide is designed to make it easy to get the game running and start making changes safely.

## 🎮 Current Game

Shadow Fighters currently has:

* 2D fighting
* Player vs Player
* CPU opponent
* Easy / Normal / Hard CPU difficulty
* Punch and kick attacks
* Blocking
* Jumping
* Crouching
* Health and damage
* Knockback
* 60-second rounds

# 🖥️ Getting Started

## 1. Install LÖVE

You need **LÖVE 11.5** to run the game.

On Linux Mint/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install love
```

Check that it installed:

```bash
love --version
```

You should see something similar to:

```text
LOVE 11.5
```

---

# 📥 2. Download the Project

If you are starting from scratch, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fightgamedev/Shadowfighter.git
```

Then enter the project:

```bash
cd Shadowfighter
```

---

# ▶️ 3. Run the Game

From inside the project folder:

```bash
love .
```

The game window should open.

---

# 🎮 Controls

## Player 1

| Key | Action        |
| --- | ------------- |
| A   | Move left     |
| D   | Move right    |
| W   | Jump          |
| S   | Crouch        |
| J   | Punch         |
| K   | Kick          |
| L   | Block         |
| R   | Restart match |

## Player 2

When CPU mode is disabled:

| Key | Action     |
| --- | ---------- |
| ←   | Move left  |
| →   | Move right |
| ↑   | Jump       |
| ↓   | Crouch     |
| N   | Punch      |
| M   | Kick       |
| B   | Block      |

# 🤖 CPU Mode

Fighter 2 is controlled by the CPU by default.

CPU settings are near the top of `main.lua`.

Look for:

```lua
cpuEnabled = true
```

To play against another human:

```lua
cpuEnabled = false
```

CPU difficulty:

```lua
cpuDifficulty = "normal"
```

Available difficulties:

```text
easy
normal
hard
```

# 🧑‍💻 Working on the Game

You do **not** need to understand the entire game before making changes.

Start small.

Good first changes include:

* Changing movement speed
* Changing damage
* Changing attack timing
* Changing CPU behavior
* Changing health
* Changing round time
* Improving visual effects

Before changing something, look at the existing code and try to understand what it does.

**Don't rewrite large sections unless necessary.**

---

# 🌿 Git Basics

We use Git to keep track of changes.

Think of it as a save system for the entire project.

## Check what changed

```bash
git status
```

## See your changes

```bash
git diff
```

---

# 🆕 Start a New Feature

**Do not normally work directly on `main`.**

Create a branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
```

For example:

```bash
git checkout -b improve-cpu
```

Now you can safely work on your feature.

---

# 💾 Save Your Work

When you've made changes:

```bash
git add .
```

Then create a commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Improve CPU behavior"
```

A commit is basically a saved checkpoint.

---

# ☁️ Upload Your Work to GitHub

Push your branch:

```bash
git push -u origin my-feature
```

Replace `my-feature` with your actual branch name.

For example:

```bash
git push -u origin improve-cpu
```

---

# 🔀 Pull Requests

When your feature is finished:

1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. Open the Shadowfighter repository on GitHub.
3. Create a **Pull Request**.
4. Explain what you changed.
5. Let the other developer review it.
6. Merge it into `main` when everything looks good.

This keeps the main version of the game safe.

---

# 🔄 Getting Someone Else's Changes

Before starting new work, update your local project.

First switch to main:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Then download the latest changes:

```bash
git pull
```

If you are starting a new feature afterward:

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

---

# ⚠️ Important Git Rule

Before doing major work, make sure you know which branch you're on:

```bash
git branch
```

You should see something like:

```text
* my-feature
  main
```

The `*` shows your current branch.

**Avoid making experimental changes directly on `main`.**

---

# 🛑 If Something Goes Wrong

Don't panic.

**Do not randomly delete files or run commands you don't understand.**

First run:

```bash
git status
```

Then tell the other developer what happened.

Git usually gives us a way to recover.

---

# 🧪 Before Committing

Always test the game after making changes:

```bash
love .
```

Check that:

* The game launches.
* Fighters move.
* Attacks work.
* Health works.
* Rounds work.
* CPU works if your change affects the CPU.
* Nothing unrelated broke.

Then commit your changes.

---

# 📁 Important Files

Currently the project is intentionally very small.

```text
Shadowfighter/
│
├── conf.lua       # LÖVE game configuration
├── main.lua       # Main game code
├── README.md      # This guide
└── .gitignore     # Files Git should ignore
```

Most gameplay code is currently in:

```text
main.lua
```

As the project grows, we will eventually split the code into separate files.

---

# 🤝 Team Rules

### 1. Keep changes focused

Try not to mix unrelated changes together.

Bad:

```text
Improve CPU + redesign UI + add music + rewrite combat
```

Better:

```text
Improve CPU attack behavior
```

---

### 2. Test before committing

Don't commit something you haven't tested.

---

### 3. Write useful commit messages

Good:

```text
Improve CPU attack timing
```

```text
Add hit reaction animation
```

```text
Fix round timer
```

Bad:

```text
stuff
```

```text
update
```

```text
asdf
```

---

### 4. Communicate before changing major systems

If you want to completely rewrite something important, talk to the other developer first.

---

### 5. Don't be afraid to experiment

Use branches for experiments.

If something doesn't work, we can delete the branch without damaging `main`.

---

# 🛠️ Using Codex

Codex can help with development.

When asking Codex to modify the game:

1. Tell it exactly what you want.
2. Ask it to inspect the existing code first.
3. Make one feature at a time.
4. Test the game afterward.
5. Commit working changes.

Example:

```text
Add a simple hit-flash effect when a fighter takes damage.

Preserve all existing combat and round functionality.
Make the smallest change necessary.
Test that the game still launches at 60 FPS.
```

Avoid asking Codex to rebuild the entire game when only a small change is needed.

---

# 🚀 Project Goal

Build a fun, lightweight arcade fighting game that can run well on older hardware while gradually adding:

* More fighters
* Character selection
* Better animations
* Combos
* Special attacks
* Multiple arenas
* Sound effects
* Music
* Menus
* Controller support
* Better CPU AI

We'll add these systems one milestone at a time.

---

## 👊 Have Fun

This is a 2-person project.

Keep changes small, test often, communicate with each other, and don't be afraid to experiment.
